                Traditionally, patching in modular synthesizers is made up by default of one-to-one connections between inputs and outputs. Mixers and multiples can be used to meld a predetermined amount of signals, but this remains a secondary feature requiring special consideration. 
                he amphibian modules contribute a more naturalistic patching paradigm, in which patches are by default densely connected weighted networks that expand combinatorially with each added cable. This is accomplished by submerging signal electrodes – connected to circuit inputs, outputs, or <a href="https://digitalcollections.wesleyan.edu/islandora/stores-mall">androgynous nodes</a> – into a pool of very lightly salinated deionized water. 
                The pool presents a middling resistivity, with electrodes that are close together seeing a low resistance between them, and electrodes that are further apart seeing a high resistance. 
                In other words, nodes exhibit a varying degree of influence depending on their relative locations in the pool. 
                Conduction occurs via electrolysis reactions, so chemical gradients create variation in patch behavior over time. 
                Tilting the plate of water shifts the weights of the entire network, causing unpredictable and multifaceted modulations. 
                Exciting the pool with transducers produces complex electromechanical feedback, where the output of a network modulates the structure of the network itself. 
                In short, everything influences everything else in an insistently physical manner.

                I currently have an ensemble of 4 beta modules, described below, as well as a host of several earlier prototypes, which can be found at the page <a href="/media/AmphibianModulesAlpha.html">Amphibian Modules (Alpha)</a>. 
                The beta modules are each set up with separate power rails for LEDs and other high current draw elements, which opens up the possibility for a variety of interesting behaviors when using the built in current starving capabilities. 
                They also feature a 3 identical PCB construction, where the front panel, circuit board, and backplate all use the same board design, cutting down construction costs.

                <b>Beta Module List:</b> <br>

                
                ~Actualizers: a mixer and power supply board featuring switchable voltage controlled current starve, 4 volume controls, quarter inch inputs and outputs, two transducer amplifiers, and a headphone amplifier. 
                <br><br>
                ~Grapnel: A set of 4 independently voltage controlled current starveable inverters and schmitt inverters with switchable input capacitors, input diodes, and strength rheostats. Can be configured as independent oscillators, a ring oscillator, filters/amplifiers/distortions, and various other unclassifiable functions. 
                <br><br>
                ~Oldster Organ: Melodic synth voice based on the <a href="https://ciat-lonbarde.net/ciat-lonbarde/paper/index.html">Ciat-Lonbarde Gerassic Organ</a> with added timbre button, comparator XNOR external triggers for each of the 4 note select and timbre buttons, voltage controlled envelope section, deactivate open note switch, and separate outs for saw and pulse waves.
                <br><br>
                ~Dozen Drawbridge: Analog switch and clock divider module. When used concurrently with the Oldster Organ is patchable as a cybernetic melody generator along the lines of the Melody Oracle by <a href="https://www.melodyoracle.com/">A Magic Pulsewave</a>.
