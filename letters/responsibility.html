                From a certain vantage point, the morning gave the impression that something insignificant had gone wrong. 
                The professor delivered a lecture reviewing basis vectors. 
                There was a piece of magic wand on the ground. The brown earth came up to meet black and chrome plastic. 
                Most of the sticks and dirt appeared mushy but, frozen over, had a crunch. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                “Why are different textures important in food?” One user replied that adding another dimension is important. 
                We then have mouth-feel on one axis and taste on another and more taste does not mean more mouth-feel because 
                they are different things that should not be confused with one another. But one could have mouth-feel and taste as 
                part of one thing and taste and mouth-feel as part of another thing and then the things should be confused with one 
                another because they are the same. But one wouldn’t have mouth-feel and taste as part of the same thing without another 
                thing that wasn’t the same thing because then one would only have one thing. One should want to be responsible for their 
                own actions, so I stood up straight.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                I looked straight at the ground and the ground looked black and chrome. Saturated dirt peaked out from behind a 
                plate of ice. The ice was intact because I didn’t step on it. I thought that from one angle, there is nothing 
                stopping anyone from doing anything. I faced straight in the direction that I was walking, which is convention. 
                After some time had passed, there was no more walking to do because where I was going had become where I was at. 
                There were still other things for me to do, including both laundry and homework. I thought that I could do both at 
                once. Then there would be more walking to do, including out of my room and into the laundry room. I thought about it.
                 It seemed like it wasn’t the kind of thing that was worth it to do. The taste of my breakfast had changed in my mouth,
                and what was sweet had become salty. I thought about that berry that has the protein miraculin. It turns sour into sweet. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Miracles happen all the time. For instance, I may have turned off the lamp when I left, I can’t remember. The morning 
                tasted so sweet. Playing a game with yourself can be just as nice as playing with a friend. I wonder if I should be eating
                 more protein. It turns sour into sweet. The lamp could look black, or it could look chrome. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                “Why is protein important in food?” An article replied that it helps speed recovery after exercise or injury. From one 
                angle, building lean muscle is easy. But one should stretch before and after exercise because they are different things 
                that should not be confused with one another. One should want to be responsible for their own actions, so I lay my back 
                on the ground and let everything release. This prevents injury.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Injury happens due to conflict. There are eye injuries and there are brain injuries and they should not be 
                confused with one another. Generally, there are four types of conflicts, intrapersonal, interpersonal, intragroup 
                and intergroup (<a href = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30739920/">Piryani and Piryani 2019</a>). Thomas and Kilmann 
                postulated a matrix explaining five distinct responses or styles to conflict resolution or management varying along the 
                axis of assertiveness and cooperativeness. Ibid. Assertiveness and cooperativeness are different things which should not 
                be confused with one another. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                One should not try to change assertiveness into cooperativeness, this would be magic. One is black and the other is chrome. 
                Sometimes the ground looks cooperative but, frozen over, is actually assertive. The professor explained that adding another 
                dimension is important, to avoid injury. There are still other things to do, like adding taste and mouthfeel, which conflict
                 and should not be confused with one another, when you think about it. Ibid. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                You can use it to change one thing into another. For instance, you can change sour into sweet. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                The wand became interpersonal. 

            </p>
