                I learned something today, or at least I was put in a place to remember it. 
                When something burns it produces ash. This is good stuff. 
                When wet it makes lye which in turn can be mixed with animal fat to make soap.

            <p class="indent">
                Soap can be used to:

            We first started doing this back in 2000. Later, in the Renaissance, soap-makers introduced new ingredients like lard and tallow.

            Since the Middle Ages, it was common for the participants of carnival parades to throw objects at the crowd, mostly <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confetti">mud balls, eggs, coins or fruit</a>. 
            This practice was succeeded by the tossing of coriander seeds, and then paper strips which we now call confetti. 
            Ash can be used as confetti in place of paper, mylar, or metallic materials. 
            It is a sustainable choice that makes use of natural buoyancy. 
            Confetti is commonly used at social gatherings such as parties, weddings, and Bar Mitzvahs. 
            Frantz Fanon wrote that <a href= "https://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/fanon/pitfalls-national.htm">“the party should be decentralized in the extreme.”</a>
            I think he would have liked confetti, for this reason.

                On the way home today I saw a mouse, or something, burrowed in the snow. 
                It had a very tiny pink nose that was quivering. It squeaked. I got close. 
                It stopped the squeaks. Snow is like ash except it is cold and white. 
                If you heat it up, it melts. 
                Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. 
                Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by <a href = https://www.westarctica.wiki/index.php/Snow> sintering, sublimation, and freeze-thaw</a>.
                Snow affects such <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow#:~:text=Snow%20affects%20such%20human%20activities,and%20snowmachine%20travel%3B%20and%20warfare.> human activities as transportation</a>: by creating the need for keeping roadways, wings, and windows clear; agriculture: by providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock; sports such as skiing, snowboarding, and snowmachine travel; and warfare.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Confetti, and thus ash can be used for warfare. For example, you can buy “<a href = https://www.amazon.com/GBHJJ-Handheld-Confetti-Launcher-Electronic/dp/B0B74V3WZJ> Handheld 5 Shot Confetti Gun Confetti Launcher, Electronic Jet Confetti Machine Confetti Guns for Parties for Kids Confetti Maker for Party Wedding</a>.” 
                Confetti (disambiguation), and thus ash, is a <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confetti_(1927_film)>1927 British drama film</a>, <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confetti_(2006_film)>and a 2006 British mockumentary film </a>. 
                These are not films about war. You can’t film confetti, and thus ash, and thus snow, if you are warlike. 
                If you paint ash white and put it in a cooler, it becomes cold and white. 
                However, it does not necessarily become snow. 
                Ash should not be used for glitter, because glitter is universally shiny, and ash is universally grey.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Ash, and thus snow, can be used for agriculture to improve soil pH, add nutrients, and stop the squeaks. 
                It is a sustainable choice that makes use of natural nutrients. It is a 1927 British mockumentary film. 
                It is a sustainable choice that makes use of neutral documents. Confetti, and thus snow, and thus ash, can be used to get rid of stiffness. 
                Stiffness is accumulated snow metamorphoses by sintering. Stiff things freeze in hexagonal shaped crystals, like a mouse. 
                We first started doing this back in the Renaissance. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Ash is mostly mud balls, eggs, coins or fruit that have been burnt up and metamorphosed. 
                If you heat it up, it melts. Because of this, it can be used to keep fingernails clean. 
                As was said in the Middle Ages, “clean nails, clean habits.” 
                The mouse nibbled on a coriander seed, a sustainable choice that made use of its natural nutrients. 
                There was a buoyancy everywhere.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Getting rid of stiffness isn’t easy, but it can be done with good stuff like lard and tallow, or coins or fruit. 
                A pink nose that is quivering is never stiff. I got close. It is universally shiny.
            </p>
